# Passord Generator

## Description

This program will generate a password based on the information that a user feeds it. A user will be able to generate a password with a character limit between 8-128. The program will also ask the user if they would like capital, lowercase, numbers or special characters in the generated password. Clicking okay on any of those questions will guarantee at least one character in the password will be a selected character. Selecting cancel on a prompt will mean that specific character type will not be in the password. The program will only generate a password when only one prompt is checked.
